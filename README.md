# Primer-Hunter
Primer Hunter is a Python-based bioinformatics tool for detecting primer binding sites in single-stranded DNA sequences. It scans DNA input and reports binding positions, making it useful for students and researchers in genetics and molecular biology.
## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Detects exact matches of a primer in DNA
- Returns all binding site positions (1-based indexing)
- Works with any plain text DNA sequence input

Future Improvements

Allow mismatches (fuzzy matching)

Multiple primer support

FASTA format compatibility

Visualization of binding sites
